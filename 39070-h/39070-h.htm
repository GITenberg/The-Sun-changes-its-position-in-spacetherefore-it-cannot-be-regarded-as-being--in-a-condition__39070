<p>Astronomical science, at the present day
insists upon the system of Copernicus, which,
as is well known, is based upon the theory
<i>of a fixed sun</i>, and remains convinced of the
incontrovertible truth and importance of this
system, even after it has become an incontestable
fact, that the sun changes its position;
endeavouring to explain away this discrepancy
by the sophism, that the sun may be considered
as <i>in a condition of rest</i>. But the
smallest movement of the sun overthrows the
entire fabric of Copernicus. Unless we take into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
account the observations, made for the last
3000 years, respecting the movement of the
sun in space, it is impossible to comprehend
the solar system and its movements. Theory
must take notice of the phenomena of the sun's
own movement and dare not cloak it under
imaginary causes; for so long as the motion
of the sun is ignored, it is impossible to know
thoroughly the motion of the earth which
follows it, and if the motion of the earth be
not known, it is also impossible to know the
motion of the other heavenly bodies, belonging
to the solar system, as seen from the earth.
In a word, the astronomical theory, as it is
now generally accepted and believed to be the
only and doubtless true, is wholly untenable,
requiring <i>a total and essential</i> reformation;
astronomical authors cling to J. H. Mädler's
assertion, that every body will understand the
impossibility for an astronomer of our time
to enter upon any other system even by way
of trial.</p>

<p>If this theory be converted into a <i>dogma</i>,
stagnation must commence and all progress
becomes impossible. In the history of science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and its advance, we find that there have been
at all times new theories propounded, which
had often to be changed later on, or even set
aside by others diametrically opposite. The
principal circumstance which renders the
system of Copernicus impossible, is that the
orbits of the planets <i>are considered as closed
curves around the sun</i>. This view has frequently
been attacked; but it is maintained
by astronomers, as it is requisite for the elucidation
of the system. Still it is evident that
if the centre of attraction moves forward the
bodies attracted by it <i>cannot move around it</i>.</p>

<p>Let us examine the system of Copernicus.
Ptolemæus first introduced his system among
the ancients. The earth was the fixed centre
of the world and around it moved the moon,
the sun, the planets and the stars. This system
lasted for XV centuries.</p>

<p>The Ptolemaic system was modified by
Copernicus, and the system of Copernicus was
simply the inversion of the Ptolemaic. The
sun took the place of the earth. In the centre
was a fixed point (earth or sun), around which
the planets moved in larger or smaller orbits.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The main feature of both systems is that
one of the heavenly bodies is <i>stationary, in
order that the others may travel round it</i>.</p>

<p>Copernicus makes the sun <i>to be motionless</i>,
and the scientific world bows before his authority.
Then we have the recurrent curves,
<i>closed orbits</i> (or ellipses) with their axes and
their <i>invariable plains</i>; for the planets <i>move
round the centre of the fixed sun</i>.</p>

<p>Whilst however learned men were striving
with feverish ardour to confirm the system of
Copernicus; whilst they were endeavouring to
demonstrate in every possible way and by various
means clearly, <i>that the sun is immoveable</i>:
there came the discovery <i>that the sun moves</i>.</p>

<p>The astronomers of the past century proved
that the sun not only has the apparent motion,
which every one sees; but that it also has a
motion proper to itself. Herschel commenced
defining the course and direction of it, and
now-a-days no one doubts the truth of this
fact, it being the general opinion that not
only the sun moves itself, but that nothing
at all in the world is in a state of rest. Astro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>nomers,
however, are of opinion that this discovery
is of <i>no consequence whatever as regards
the system of Copernicus, which is still considered
by them to be the most correct of all and
the only possible one</i>. For more than a century
there has not been found a single astronomer
or scientific man, to whom it has occurred
<i>that the motion proper to the sun,
might have, in some way or another, an influence
on the present state of theoretical science</i>.
They all seem to regard <i>this fact</i> as an accident,
involving no consequences and quite
incapable of distracting them from their labours,
which they continue to work in the same
manner as is indicated in the system of
Copernicus.</p>

<p>If an advancing motion is admitted to be
the motion proper to the sun, <i>the orbits traversed
by the planets cannot be closed</i>.</p>

<p>But the question may be asked: is it true
that science contradicts itself in this way? We
reply: Yes! astronomical <i>observation has overtaken
theoretical or explicative science</i>. <i>Theory
has stood still.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to set their minds at rest, learned
men explain what they wish to explain, and
just as heavenly phenomena were accounted
for according the systems of Ptolemæus, of
Copernicus and of Tycho de Brahe, so too
there will be no lack of good reasons to account
for the motion proper to the sun; only
history will tell us that the astronomers of
the last but one decennium of the XIX<sup>th</sup> century
have taught by writing and speaking in their
schools, that the sun is at the same time moving
and not moving.</p>

<p>A science which cannot make any use of
this immense discovery, nor deduce any application
from it, does not possess any vital
power; it is a dead science, it is strangled by
those whose duty is to keep it alive, to
lead it onwards to perfection.</p>

<p>Astronomers assert "<i>that the sun conducts
its system with himself in mundane space</i>,"
but in the same breath they add: "<i>with
reference however to the planets it may be
regarded as in a state of rest</i>."</p>

<p>Hence astronomers have discovered <i>a motion
which is at rest</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>If the sun is <i>not fixed</i>, the system of
Copernicus falls to ground. Either the sun
moves, or does not; a moving sun in a condition
of rest, <i>is an impossibility</i>.</p>

<p>If the sun moves, there is <i>no fixed centre</i>,
there are <i>no closed or recurrent curves and
no plains of orbits</i>. If these must be obtained
at any price, the sun must be definitively
fixed, it cannot be permitted <i>to move onwards
and yet at the same time not to move</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that the sun moves, cannot now
be altered and cannot be any longer ignored;
and if mathematicians and astronomers do notwithstanding
assert, that the sun may with
reference to its own planetary system be
regarded as fixed, or in a condition of rest,
in that the system moves as a whole without
any change taking place in the relative position
of the planets to each other, or in their
relation to the sun; in fact without any alteration
taking place in the <i>configuration</i> of the
system&mdash;we reply, this is one of those
meaningless phrases, which should find no
place in a scientific discussion. <i>A body which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is in motion cannot be in any way regarded
as being motionless</i>, it would be just as
reasonable to say that a locomotive, dragging
a train of carriages full of passengers, could
with reference to the latter be regarded as
motionless.</p>

<p>The actual meaning of such an assertion is
that the planets are attached to the sun in
such a manner, that they can neither approach
to, nor recede from it, but must follow it
whithersoever it goes.</p>

<p>We may in thought pursue a train of
hypotheses and suppositions, but they do not
thereby acquire reality; still, in a normal
condition of the human intellect, it is impossible
to conceive that any thing can exist and not
exist at the same time.</p>

<p>From this confusion of ideas, it might seem
as if theoretical astronomy had got into an
untenable position which is irreconcilable with
science and ought therefore to endeavour
to enter upon a better state, as soon as
possible. <i>Theory ought therefore, either to
have accepted as a fact, the motion proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to the sun with all its inevitable consequences,
or else, to have denied this motion altogether.</i>
But the astronomers ignore this alternative,
they have decided, once for all and irrevocably
<i>that the sun moves and that at the same time
it shall be motionless</i>. In this manner science
loses its reputation and all learnedly technical
expressions and formulas are not sufficient to
cover the weak part. <i>The sun cannot be
rendered motionless</i>, and if astronomers and
men of science of the present day continue
to ignore this fact, they need not be surprised
at the inevitable consequences of their
own acts.</p>

<p>The system of Copernicus presupposes the
<i>fixity of the sun</i>, as a "conditio sine qua
non." The most abstruse investigations into
the "celestial mechanism" could not be made
without this axiom be granted. The mathematician
must have a fixed point, a fixed central
point of action for his coordinates, he wants
fixed invariable plains and closed curves, a
radius vector describing plains, he wants axes
and poles for the orbits, in order that they
may describe certain figures in the heaven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that the plains of the orbits may move,&mdash;one
of the other.</p>

<p>Naturally astronomers and men of science
have never asked themselves the question, <i>how
a heavenly body could be fixed in space</i>.</p>

<p>When an astronomer asserts that the Copernician
system is the only possible, he believes
that it is impossible for the sun to have any
motion of its own; when he at the same time
asserts that all astronomy stands or falls with
this system, he believes that no astronomical
knowledge existed before the discovery of the
Copernician system, and with the fall of the
system all astronomical knowledge will cease
to exist; he believes moreover true astronomy
to be <i>that</i>, which men of science have imagined
to be the truth regarding the heaven
and the causes of the phenomena we see.</p>

<p>If astronomers had merely presented their
ideas and opinions to the world as such, and
no more, no one could raise any objection; but
they lay down their opinions in words and on
paper as a <i>positive science</i>, they give their
view as <i>incontroversible truths</i>, and <i>this fact</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
alters the situation, for we cannot admit that
science is a mere barge to be taken in tow
by the imagination.</p>

<p>The fundamental axiom of astronomical
theory, such as the Copernician system, Kepler's
and Newton's laws, <i>are not derived from a
knowledge of fact</i>, they are the opinions, views,
ideas and suppositions of individuals, which
have been adapted to the heaven, and as they
were generally accepted, the question was
never raised whether the opinions of an organic
creature&mdash;however intelligent it might be&mdash;are
really and truly that which we term penetrating
behind the veil of nature and compelling it
to yield up its secrets. The fact of no other
ideas being at hand which seemed to be better,
sufficed to transform these opinions into rules
and to cause them to be accepted as the only
admissible and correct truths.</p>

<p>The opinions set forth by Copernicus, Kepler
and Newton are designed by astronomers of
the present day under the collective title of
the Copernician system, and they believe that
these three dogmas, systems and laws, distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
as they are from each other, proceed consequentially
one from the other, that they
mutually supplement each the other, and thus
form a harmonious whole. That not one of
these things rests upon actual observation or
even probable and perceptible facts, and finally,
that none of them can be observed or verified,
but that they are all three creations of the
imagination, must be clearly evident to any
one who occupies himself at all with the study
of nature and more especially with the study
of the heavenly phenomena.</p>

<p>When we say that astronomy is an earthly
science, we mean to imply that the heaven
and the phenomena there apparent cannot be
studied otherwise than as seen from the earth.
Therefore astronomy is not a heavenly science,
it consists solely of such ideas as we are able
to form, that which we see on the heaven.</p>

<p>It is not astronomy that is grand, compared
with the vast objects with which it deals it
dwindles to insignificance, and we may say
that to speak of it as being a science of
the "heavenly mechanism," nay more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
"laws of the universe," is sheer nonsense. The
<i>universe</i> must be for us a mere term, which
does not convey any tangible idea to our
minds.</p>

<p>As only a very small portion of the heavenly
space and its contents is visible to our eyes,
astronomy&mdash;whatever may be the magnifying
power placed at its disposal&mdash;must be confined
within the limits of our vision and can therefore
be no more than a small fragment.</p>

<p>In the positive sense of the word, astronomy
is more especially a science of <i>observation</i>,
which is its <i>only</i>, but real and successful
power. It may be said that astronomy has
raised observation to a science, and its immense
importance becomes more and more
prominent as the explicative science loses
in value; which is the more easily accounted
for by the fact that observation will
finally bring about the overthrow of all untenable
theories.</p>

<p>We see the heaven as we fly along, the
earth whirls us with itself through space, hence
astronomy cannot make any drawing room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
experiment, it cannot reproduce any of the
heavenly phenomena, it can do nothing but
<i>observe</i>. If therefore the science of astronomy
be more especially an observative science, that
which it does not and cannot observe, must
be for it as good as not existent. But astronomy
may, in addition, be designated <i>the science
of observation of the apparent things</i>, things
as they seem to be, for it is unable to see
or regard the heavenly phenomena otherwise
than they present themselves to it. <i>Astronomy
is not permitted to observe realities.</i></p>

<p>If therefore <i>observation is itself a science</i>,
it must necessarily <i>be the basis of theory</i>;
observation may be set aside&mdash;which is what
is actually done&mdash;in this way we may plod
on, we may term our labour what we please;
but whatever is produced in this way is not
astronomy.</p>

<p>But that glorious science whose sublime
object is alone able to unfetter the mind of
poor humanity&mdash;Astronomy&mdash;has a future
before it. Any such as feel themselves called
upon to study <i>seriously</i> the phenomena of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
nature, may set about the task. <i>The sun is
a sure guide.</i></p>

<p>The great mass of astronomical observations
are almost exclusively of European origin, those
which in later times have been made in other
parts of the earth, are of a special character&mdash;they
refer for the most part to the stars
and are not numerous enough to furnish
any general view, but here the question is of
establishing a universal astronomy available
for the whole earth, which, founded on the
actual type of the phenomena, will become
the result of science.</p>

<p>With respect to astronomical knowledge
and its dissemination, the discovery and proving
of this type of the phenomena is of the
greatest importance, they must be found out
not by calculation, but <i>by actual observation</i>.
When discovered, a large number of important
and still undecided problems will be advanced
towards solution.</p>

<p>It may be asked: how and where shall we
however find this <i>original type</i>? and the earth
itself supplies the answer by means of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>&mdash;<b>Equator</b>.
No observer, placed either north
or south the equator, can see the two poles
of the heaven at once, he cannot see the
<i>whole heavenly sphere</i>; at the equator the
entire splendour of the firmament passes before
his eyes during the space of&mdash;12 hours.</p>

<p>The <i>equator of the earth</i> is always turned
towards the sun, and it thus indicates the
direction taken by our planet; therefore we
must be able to find this type <i>at the equator</i>.
Either it is there, or it is nowhere else, and
it is indispensably necessary that astronomical
observations made elsewhere should be repeated
at the equator thus as it were confirmed.</p>

<p>The erection of small, simple and detached
observations along the line of the earth's
equator, at certain distances from each other,
and the subdivision of the work amongst the
various observers, according the objects, would
be of incalculable consequence, and would in
the course of a few years shed more light upon
astronomical knowledge than all that has hitherto
been done at hap-hazard and without
any plan. An international scientific society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
could take the matter in hand. Instruments
of the most excellent kind are to be had in
plenty, and there is no lack of young and
intelligent men. Moreover, ever since 1874
there has been established at Quito, the "Observatorio
de Collegio Nacional," the director
of which Mr. G. B. Menton might superintend
the preliminary operations until such time as
the work could be prosecuted with greater
resources and according to a well considered
plan. Such men as <i>Lick</i>, <i>Bischoffsheim</i>,
<i>Remeis</i> <i>etc.</i>, who are willing to make sufficient
sacrifices in order to establish this glorious
science upon more solid foundations, which
do not rest on an imaginary and untenable
theory, <i>but on actual observation</i>, will surely
be found. Success cannot be doubtful. Would
not the Americans, who appreciate every thing
on a grand scale and are not afraid of any
expense in their undertakings, do all in their
power to further and promote this splendid
work?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>If&mdash;as is well known&mdash;matters are
not as they are assumed to be, to what purpose
have been and are these laborious works
prosecuted and the undying works written?
If the imaginary is preferred to reality, we
set up an imaginary science, without knowing
anything about the heaven, and the science
thus set up will become the plaything of
fancy.</p>

<p>If they inquire, why theory denies reality&mdash;<i>the
motion of the sun</i>&mdash;we shall find
that it is because it prefers the imaginary. <i>The
sun in motion</i> destroys the found illusions of
the astronomers, this they will not submit to,
their <i>untenable theory</i> must continue to be
looked upon as unadulteratest truth, and the
consequence is that the manifestations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
grand and sublime Nature are put down
as lies.</p>

<p>This idea <i>of a fixed sun</i> has taken such
a firm hold of men's minds that there is no
force in nature capable of exercising sufficient
power to eradicate it, the sun may move as it
pleases, and whilst the whither and rapidity
of its motion are diligently studied, men's
minds are occupied <i>with its fixity</i>, and these
"investigations and inquiries" are prosecuted
without any consequences being therefrom
deduced. Directly a theory or a law is to
be set up, the sun is at once <i>very firmly fixed</i>
on&mdash;<b>ether</b>. Astronomical writers consider
that they have done quite enough, when they
have accorded honorable mention to the motion
of the sun, <i>but their deductions, conclusions,
theories, proofs and laws are all based on the
immobility of the sun, according the system
of Copernicus</i>.</p>

<p>The idea <i>that the motion of the sun</i> does
not necessitate any alteration in the system
of Copernicus leads us to the utmost absurdity.
If the earth is to move in the <i>invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
plain of its recurrent and closed ellipse</i>, it stands
to reason, it cannot follow the sun, and the
"circulation around the centre" at once falls
to the ground.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable fact, that the astronomers
of the by-gone century could, and those
of the present century can believe, such as
Copernicus, Kepler and Newton, had they been
aware of the motion of the sun, would have
set up the same system, the same laws and
theories, <i>as they based exclusively on the theory
of its being immoveable</i>. This fact is one
of which we are right to be ashamed.</p>

<p>The astronomers hug themselves, with
great complacency, with the idea&mdash;which
gradually becomes a delicious certainly&mdash;that
they have mapped out the heaven very well,
and that any change in the arrangement is a
thing not to be thought of. If therefore any
one of their fellows should get up&mdash;which
has sometimes occurred&mdash;and say: "it is high
time that we should clear up the science and
subject this untenable theory to a strict examination
and test," the immense majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
facultists and authorities proclaim unanimously
"<b>non possumus</b>," which is after all but a
lingual verification of the first law of the
nature<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Why is it that the astronomers of the
present day are unwilling to take into consideration
and to study the consequences arising
from the motion proper to the sun, with
reference to its own system?</p>

<p>Why is it that they are unwilling to recognise
or rather to grasp properly and to explain
the apperceivable phenomena, which the motion
proper to the sun, as seen from the surface
of the earth, must produce on the apparently
hollow sphere of the heaven?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
